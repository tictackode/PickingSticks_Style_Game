# PickingSticks_Style_Game
 This project is a graphical version of the classic picking sticks game/project. In this version I've used C\C++ language, Allegro4 for graphics, and DevC++ (not the orwell's) with allegro4 devpack. This project can be used as a game template to start the development of a new game.
